# Roadmap-to-CP

### What is Competitive Programming?
It teaches you how to think?. If you are a programmer you might have understood the deep meaning of these lines quoted by Steve Jobs and you might have also experienced that even after shutting your computer you keep on thinking about programming stuff or code you have written in your project. Once you enter in programming you just don’t learn how to code but you also learn the “art of thinking”, by breaking your code into smaller chunks and then using your logic-based creativity to solve a problem from different angles. Programming is fun, programming is an exercise for your brain, programming is a mental sport and when this sport is held over the internet involving sport programmer as a contestant then it is called Competitive Programming<br>[Wikipedia Page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Competitive_programming)<br>[What is Competitive Programming by William Lin](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ueNT-w7Oluw)

### Why we should do competitive programming?
* Helps improve logic and problem solving skills
* Makes you faster and more focused
* Hands on implementation of algorithms learned
* Lab assignments will seem to you like a piece of cake.
* Habit of writing efficient code 
* It’s a way to publicly demonstrate your skills.
* Make you placement ready
* Good salary!

### How to get started?
How did you learn to play jigsaw puzzle, sudoku, tic-tac-toe, counter strike or other games?. You might have taken help from some people to know game rules, you might have also practiced those games to become a master in all of that. It might have been challenging for you initially but later all these games become easier when you practiced enough and played continuously. The same thing happens in CP as well. We are going to give you a short description that you should follow to start with competitive programming.
1. **Choose a Programming Language:** You should have the knowledge of at least one programming language to step into CP. That programming language will be a tool for you or you can say al language for you to build your thought process and convert that into coding for a given problem. It can be anything C, C++, Java, Python or any programming language you are comfortable with.
2. **Understand the Concept of Time and Space Complexity:** You need to find the best solution i.e optimal one learning these two concepts. So dig yourself into these two topics to know how much time and space an algorithm takes to solve a problem.
3. **Learn the Fundamentals of Data Structures and Algorithms:** DSA is the major part of programming. You need to find out the best algorithm i.e approach and best data structure suitable for your problems. Array, Linked List, Stack, Searching, Sorting all these are part of DSA so learn these two most important fundamentals to start CP. GeeksforGeeks also provide different courses to boost your DSA Preparation at a very low cost. You can check the course details from the Courses portal.
4. **Take the Challenge and Solve Coding Problems:** You need to take part in coding challenges on different coding platforms. GeeksforGeeks, CodeChef, HackerRank and alot of platforms are there. Once you practiced some questions start participating in the coding contests.
5. **Practice and Do it Regularly:** Yes…do it regularly to be proficient in it. Your consistency is very important to solve the challenges in CP. It would be difficult initially and you might be frozen out seeing some questions, so start from the basics and gradually increase the level but stick on it and participate in different coding competitions.

### What are the best Languages to get started with CP?
* **C++**<br>
Indeed, C++ is one of the most recommended and widely used programming languages for Competitive Programming. C++, developed by Bjarne Stroustrup, is a relatively faster programming language in comparison to various other renowned languages. Meanwhile, as the execution time plays a crucial role in Competitive Programming, hence C++ is the most preferred language by the programmers. The general-purpose programming language consists of a rich library known as Standard Template Library that makes it easier for the programmers to do efficient & effective programming. The Standard Template Library includes C++ template classes that offer various data structures such as lists, trees, stacks, graphs, arrays, etc. Moreover, the language supports OOPS (Object-Oriented Programming) features as well to help you out while solving real-time problems in coding challenges.
* **JAVA**<br>
Here comes another most recommended programming language for Competitive Programming — JAVA. The object-oriented language, developed in 1995, works on Write Once, Run Anywhere concept which implies that the compiled Java code can be executed on any platform, that supports Java, without the recompilation. Meanwhile, JAVA comes up with a rich library set such as BigInteger class used for calculation based on large integers or Regular Expressions, Geometry Library to handle geometrical problems, and many more. Furthermore, various other worthwhile features supported by JAVA such as better exception handling, Java Containers, etc. make it one of the most preferred languages for Competitive Programming. Moreover, the language is easy to learn and you can start to learn JAVA from various online & offline resources.
* **PYTHON**<br>
Python gives you numerous reasons to pick it up for your next Competitive Programming contest. The high-level programming language is quite easy to learn and implement with having a very simple syntax. Moreover, the language has an extensive library & function support which somehow increases the efficiency of programmers in coding competitions. Furthermore, the language has several other worthwhile features as well such as no limit on the integer value, functions can return more than one value, code indentation, robust input statements, flexible number of arguments to a function, etc. that makes Python a suitable language for Competitive Programming. Also, the language has wide use in various trending domains such as Machine Learning, Artificial Intelligence, Data Science, and many more
